# zabbix-tools

A CLI tool for interacting with Zabbix API built in Rust.

API test call implemented.  Add host function has been included for prototyping, but largely relies on static JSON.

To-do:
Convert static JSON text to struct - both work with serde_json but struct will look cleaner and be less error prone.
